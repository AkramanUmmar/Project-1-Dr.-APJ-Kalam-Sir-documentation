                <strong>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam </strong> was an eminent Indian scientist and statesman who served as the

                    India</b>
                from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam was known as the "Missile
                Man
                of India" for his pioneering work in the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dr. Kalam</b> graduated from the Madras Institute of Technology in aeronautical engineering and
                joined India's
                Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
                He
                played a pivotal role in India's space and missile development programs, including the development of
                satellite launch vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Dr. Kalam's</b> most significant contribution came in leading the development of India's first
                indigenous
                satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit.
                Later, as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister, he played a key role in India's nuclear
                tests
                of 1998.
            </p>

                "Wings of
                Fire," an autobiography which details his early life and career. His inspirational speeches and vision
                for
                India's youth made him a beloved figure across the nation
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Dr. Kalam</b> was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, in 1997 for his
                contributions to
                the
                scientific research and modernization of defense technology in India. Even after his presidency, he
                remained
                an active advocate for science, education, and societal development until his passing on July 27, 2015.
                Dr.
                APJ Abdul Kalam continues to be remembered as a symbol of integrity, wisdom, and inspiration for
                generations
